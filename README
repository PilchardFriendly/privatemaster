A quick recipe for testing standalone puppet clients against a bootstrapped puppet master.

This receipe sets up a private puppet master ready to run requests.  
Locations:
	/etc/puppet/private/
	/var/run/puppet/private
	/usr/share/puppet.private/system_test/manifests/spec-site.pp   #Define your default host in here
	/usr/share/puppet.private/system_test/modules		       #Location of the modules to be tested
	/usr/share/puppet.private/specs/fixtures/<scenario>	       #yaml file defining classes and properties for <hostname>
	
Run the client with at least the following arguments:
 	--server localhost --fqdn <scenario> --environment testing

You can include this in specs or features...
